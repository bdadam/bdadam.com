I found a very interesting project on Github: [FullScreenMario](https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario).
As the creator says:

> An HTML5 remake of the original Super Mario Brothers - expanded for wide screens.

The official website of the game is not working anymore, since Nintendo complained about copyright infridgement.

## Good news

We can still play the game. We just have to download the sources (or clone the repository), start a webserver locally and navigate to the local url.

1. Download this: ~~master.zip~~
2. Extract the files
3. `cd path/to/files`
4. Start a webserver (e. g. `serve` [serve](/blog/serve-a-practical-command-line-webserver.html))
5. Navigate to the game

**Have fun!**
