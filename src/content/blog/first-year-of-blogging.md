## What I learned from blogging in 2014?
* Blogging is fun
* No matter how much I understand the topic I'm writing about, it still takes a lot of time and effort to publish a post
* A few times I really used my blog to gather information about things I would have forgotten otherwise
* I want to go on and publish betters posts and more often
