The *SVG* folder contains the icons you selected as separate SVG files.

The *demo.html* lists the icons that you selected. To learn how to insert your icons as inline SVGs (with the <use> element), refer to the source of this HTML file. If you prefer to reference an external SVG instead of embedding it in the HTML, you will need to use javascript to fetch the SVG in order to make sure your SVGs will work fine in IE. IcoMoon's Quick Usage mode can take care of that and host your SVGs too.

You can ignore the *svgdefs.svg* file. It contains the same SVG <symbol> definitions as the ones you can find in the demo.html file.

If you prefer using PNGs or CSS sprites, refer to the Preferences panel of the IcoMoon app before downloading your zip pack.
