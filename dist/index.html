            <p>Embedding Google Maps in a website is very easy with its JavaScript API. A simple trick can improve the usability of large maps when users scroll with the mouse wheel over them.</p>

            <p>As a web developers we sometimes come across some tasks which are not that strictly related to development, but rather to design. For me such a task was a few days ago, when I found a neat background pattern, but the color just didn&#x27;t fit the site I was working on.</p>

            <p>I&#x27;m planning to create a simple 2D game in plain JavaScript. As the first step I would like to show, how to animate (pan or scroll) a background image using the canvas element. I am also going to show some basic setup code in order to have a loop where we can draw the frames.</p>

            <p>Every website has some links or buttons, users are clicking on them. But do webmasters know which ones do users click most often? Are there maybe some, which are not clicked at all? Maybe you just built a shiny new navigation and you may ask &quot;do users use it?&quot;. Clicktracking gives you the answer. When using Google Analytics the results are just shown on your dashboard.</p>

            <p>Personally, I was always missing some sort of comparison helper in Handlebars.js. I know, I know, it&#x27;s sort of being against the philosophy of Handlebars - being logicless. But I still wanted to have it.</p>

            <p class="muted center">11th February 2014</p>
            
            
                <p>In JavaScript it is perfectly valid to have a return statement in a finally block. But this doesn&#39;t mean, you should really put it in there.
Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">function whatDoesThisReturn() {
    try {
        return false;
    } finally {
        return true;
    }
}

console.log(whatDoesThisReturn());</code></pre>
<p>Basically the <code>finally</code> block is called after the <code>try</code> block, therefore it overrides the return value.</p>
<p><em>So this function returns <code>true</code>.</em></p>

            <p>JavaScript has always supported basic properties on objects. But the time is approaching when IE8 support is not relevant anymore, so we can use a more modern approach (ES5) for defining properties. There is one difference though to other programming languages - like C# - that we always define properties on objects and not on types.</p>

            <p>One thing almost every website needs is redirection. Many websites decide to serve their visitors both over www and non-www site, just in case the user types it into the browser. But for SEO it&#x27;s bad, when you have the same site over two different domains. Here is, how to solve this issue with NGINX.</p>

Building a blog engine is boring, time consuming and so on. So I had to find a simpler alternative.</p>
