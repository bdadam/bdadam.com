            <p class="muted center">3rd February 2014</p>
            <p>One thing almost every website needs is redirection. Many websites decide to serve their visitors both over www and non-www site, just in case the user types it into the browser. But for SEO it&#x27;s bad, when you have the same site over two different domains. Here is, how to solve this issue with NGINX.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago I posted about my <a href="http://bdadam.com/blog/a-simple-pubsub-module-in-javascript.html">PubSub module</a>. Since then I registered it as a bower package. It was actually my first bower package. I am going to show you how easy it was.</p>

            <p class="muted center">2nd February 2014</p>
            <p>Many people think that it is some kind of magic, how AngularJS resolves dependencies given as function arguments. But it isn&#x27;t any magic. I&#x27;ll show you, how they achieve it. This technique can be used everywhere, not just with AngularJS.</p>

            <p>Have you ever needed to quickly deploy a website somewhere? Maybe to show a client some demo content? Or to show a buddy your newest static web app? Here&#x27;s the solution.</p>

            <p class="muted center">2nd February 2014</p>
            <p>Strong caching is very important nowadays since it can reduce page load times for the users (and eventually it can also reduce network transfer costs for the publishers). Here we see a simple example how to do it with NGINX for static files like css, JavaScript and images.</p>

            <p>Have you ever wondered, what&#x27;s the proper way of throwing JavaScript errors? And how to handle them? Here we&#x27;ll see some examples and we&#x27;ll define some custom error types.</p>

            <p class="muted center">30th January 2014</p>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how is it possible to support tabs in a textarea? Normally when you press the tab key, the focus jumps to the next element. But with some JavaScript &#x27;magic&#x27; it&#x27;s possible to indent or unindent the text.</p>

            <p class="muted center">29th January 2014</p>
            <p>I have to admit, I have completely overseen, that fat arrows ( =&gt; ) are coming to JavaScript. The syntax is much the same as in C#. This also means that LINQ is also on its way to the JavaScript world.</p>

            <p class="muted center">26th January 2014</p>
            <p>I was long searching for the perfect blog engine for this site. More precisely I was planning to build a blog engine myself. I wanted to keep it simple, so I didn&#x27;t want to use something overkill like Wordpress or Drupal. And I also like to code. But then I realised I don&#x27;t really need to do this. Building a blog engine is boring, time consuming and so on. So I had to find a simpler alternative.</p>

            <p class="muted center">3rd January 2014</p>
            <p>I have always been a fan of simple things, such as the PubSub pattern. A few weeks ago I discovered this pattern again, when I was looking for a way to separate some JavaScript modules which don&#x27;t really have to know about each other but have to have some sort of communication.</p>

            <p>So the new year has come and I decided to start a blog. I try to learn new things every day. Here I want to collect my thoughts and document what I have learned so far, so that I don&#x27;t forget them and don&#x27;t have to learn them again later.</p>
