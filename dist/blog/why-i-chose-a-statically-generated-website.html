But then I realised I don&#x27;t really need to do this. Building a blog engine is boring, time consuming and so on. So I had to find a simpler alternative.</p></div><h2 id="what-did-i-need-">What did I need?</h2><p>I wanted to have a website where I can show, who I am. I also wanted to write some articles and then publish them. I wanted to have some sort of statistics about my users. That&#39;s all, not that much.</p><h2 id="lets-take-a-look-at-what-i-was-planning">Lets take a look at what I was planning</h2><p>I knew I wanted to have some static pages like &#39;about me&#39;, &#39;contact&#39; and some dynamic pages like blog posts. So I need a database, right? Lets get one instance at <a href="http://mongolab.com" rel="external,nofollow">MongoLab</a>.</p><p>Then I was sure I need some continuous integration (CI) environment and a LIVE environment. That was fine, since I already have a web server. So I knew I wanted to write and edit my articles. So I need a &#39;members area&#39;, with an editor, with https connection and authentication? Then I thought it&#39;s too much for this small site. Lets look for something smaller.</p><h2 id="first-i-found-markdown-again">First I found markdown again</h2><p>I always knew that markdown is very convenient (at least for a coder). Then I came across <a href="http://stackedit.io" rel="external,nofollow">stackedit.io</a>. It the best markdown editor I have ever seen. Maybe better then a plain text editor. So I was sure I wanted to write my articles in markdown. So I don&#39;t need to have an editor myself, Stackedit does the job for me.</p><h2 id="i-remembered-i-saw-something">I remembered I saw something</h2><p>This thing was called <a href="http://wintersmith.io/" rel="external,nofollow">Wintersmith</a>. A static website generator for node.js. Unfortunately written in CoffeeScript. What a shame. But I started to use it. It was almost working but I didn&#39;t like it.</p><p>So I was looking for alternatives. And then I found <a href="http://assemble.io">Assemble</a>. It is also a static website generator, actually a GruntJS task. But I liked it better and for templating it uses handlebars instead of Jade.</p><h2 id="here-i-am-now">Here I am now</h2><p>Now I am using Assemble to generate my site. But I am not absolutely happy with it. I am missing some features, which I&#39;m going to need in a few weeks. Therefore I think I will build my own static website generator.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-statically-generating-this-site-">What are the benefits of statically generating this site?</h2><ol><li>It&#39;s fast. Every page is generated once on my desktop computer and then hosting is cheap and easy. No more surprises when a blog post accidentally hits the top of Hackernews.</li><li>Deployment is also very easy. I just have to copy some files over SCP and that&#39;s it.</li><li>Less things can be hacked. :)</li><li>No need for caching. Almost every web-server does this for us out of the box.</li><li>In the end less things can go wrong.</li></ol><h2 id="there-are-also-some-tradeoffs">There are also some tradeoffs</h2><p>Editing and publishing is definitely more complex than just hitting a button called &quot;Publish&quot;. I cannot do them conveniently over my smart phone, I need my laptop.</p><h2 id="how-does-my-workflow-look-like-">How does my workflow look like?</h2><ol><li>I write my article in markdown.</li><li>I (re)generate the html files.</li><li>Then I push the changes to <a href="http://github.com/bdadam/bdadam.com" rel="external,nofollow">my code repository</a></li><li>At last I copy the files to my webserver and check whether everything is fine. That&#39;s all.</li></ol><h2 id="why-is-my-code-repository-publicly-available-on-github-">Why is my code repository publicly available on GitHub?</h2><ol><li>I don&#39;t need to hide it in a private repository, since every page in this blog is public.</li><li>It is a good example for others who are also using (or planning to use) Assemble and are looking for some examples.</li><li>It doesn&#39;t cost a thing.</li></ol><p>So I think this is the best for my tiny blog. But I am not affraid of changes. I definitely will change everything.</p><p>Do you also like static site generation?</p><a class="silent" href="https://plus.google.com/116380265342833844173?rel=author">by Adam Beres-Deak</a><p class="share-bar"></p><a id="comments"></a><div id="disqus_thread"></div><h4>Latest blog posts</h4><p><a href="/blog/optimistic-page-loading-with-instantclick-io.html">Loading web pages really fast - optimistic page loading with Instantclick.io <span class="muted"><small>8th October 2014</small></span></a></p><p><a href="/blog/generating-sound-effects-with-client-side-javascript.html">Generating sound effects with client side JavaScript <span class="muted"><small>6th April 2014</small></span></a></p><p><a href="/blog/static-site-generation-boilerplate.html">Boilerplate for static site generation <span class="muted"><small>25th March 2014</small></span></a></p><p><a href="/blog/automatically-loading-grunt-tasks-with-matchdep.html">Automatically loading Grunt tasks with matchdep <span class="muted"><small>11th March 2014</small></span></a></p><p><a href="/blog/simple-usability-trick-for-google-maps.html">A simple usability trick for Google Maps <span class="muted"><small>10th March 2014</small></span></a></p></article><footer><p>Adam Beres-Deak &copy; 2014 <span class="social-links"><a href="mailto:me@bdadam.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://github.com/bdadam" rel="external,nofollow"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://twitter.com/bdadamm" rel="external,nofollow"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Adam_BeresDeak" rel="external,nofollow"><i class="fa fa-xing"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://plus.google.com/116380265342833844173?rel=author"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i></a></span> <a rel="external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/bdadamcom">RSS</a></p><p class="silent container">Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="external,noindex,nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a>.
