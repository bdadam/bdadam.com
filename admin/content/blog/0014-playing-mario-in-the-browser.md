Have you enjoyed playing Mario in the old days? Me too. If you want to play with it again, you just have to follow some simple steps and the game is ready to be played right in your browser. Let's try it.

I found a very interesting project on Github: <a href="https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario" rel="external,nofollow">FullScreenMario</a>.
As the creator says:
>An HTML5 remake of the original Super Mario Brothers - expanded for wide screens.

The official website of the game is not working anymore, since Nintendo complained about copyright infridgement.

## Good news
We can still play the game. We just have to download the sources (or clone the repository), start a webserver locally and navigate to the local url.
1. Download this: <a href="https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario/archive/master.zip" rel="external,nofollow">master.zip</a>
1. Extract the files
1. `cd path/to/files`
1. Start a webserver (e. g. `serve` [serve](/blog/serve-a-practical-command-line-webserver.html))
1. Navigate to the game

**Have fun!**
